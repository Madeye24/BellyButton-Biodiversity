# BellyButton-Biodiversity
Javascript
# Challenge 
We were ask to create an interactive charts, using Javascript, D3(Library) and Plotly.

Below is a screen shot of the webpage. We helped Roza with 
volunteers to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
